The Smart Holiday Lights app brings seasonal decorations into the Internet of Things!

The Android application allows the user to program a string of LEDs with a variety of colors and patterns from their phone, making holiday decorating very customizable. The LEDs are controlled by a Bluetooth-enabled Arduino Uno. This app will prompt the user to connect with the Arduino Uno over Bluetooth and then provide graphical menus allowing the lights to be programmed with a variety of colors and patterns.
